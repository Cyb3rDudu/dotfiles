# Main Zsh configuration
# Sources all modular configuration files from ~/.zshrc.d/
# Configuration is split into modular files:
#   00-env.zsh           - Common environment variables
#   01-env-darwin.zsh    - macOS-specific environment
#   01-env-linux.zsh     - Linux-specific environment
#   10-interactive.zsh   - Interactive shell tools (atuin, starship, etc.)
#   20-aliases.zsh       - Common aliases
#   99-secrets.zsh       - Secrets (gitignored, copy from template)

# Only run in interactive shells
[[ $- == *i* ]] || return

# Source all .zsh files in zshrc.d/ directory
if [ -d "$HOME/.zshrc.d" ]; then
    for file in "$HOME/.zshrc.d"/*.zsh(N); do
        [ -r "$file" ] && source "$file"
    done
fi

# Additional configurations can be added here or in zshrc.d/
