# Main Fish configuration
# Fish automatically sources all files in ~/.config/fish/conf.d/
# Configuration is split into modular files:
#   00-env.fish           - Common environment variables
#   01-env-darwin.fish    - macOS-specific environment
#   01-env-linux.fish     - Linux-specific environment
#   10-interactive.fish   - Interactive shell tools (atuin, starship, etc.)
#   99-secrets.fish       - Secrets (gitignored, copy from template)

# Additional configurations can be added here or in conf.d/
